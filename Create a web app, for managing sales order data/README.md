# Web app asignment. 

Feedback recieved.

6/10
No validations, allowing negative numbers, Mapping done manually, why not using existing tools like AutoMapper.
No Logging. BackEnd endpoints were barely validated and lots of security problems. 
Pure html, there are lots of free component libraries that you could use.
