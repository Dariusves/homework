Restore dependencies and execute both the API and Blazor projects.

Potential Enhancements
DRY Principle Compliance: There are areas in the codebase where refactoring could minimize repetition, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.

Component-Based Architecture: The "Orders" page within the Blazor app could benefit from a component-based design, improving the reusability of UI elements and streamlining future development efforts.
By addressing these areas, the project can achieve a higher standard of code quality and user experience.
